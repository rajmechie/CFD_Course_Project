Solution of the 2D conduction problem using conjugate gradient method, preconditioned conjugate gradient method with Jacobi, ILU and SIP preconditioners.
The analytical results and the numerical results are compared. For 𝑁𝑖=𝑁𝑗=4, the values of diagonals of 𝐿 and 𝑈 matrices coming from ILU and SIP factorization are compared.
The temperature variation with y along mid-vertical plane x = 0.5 obtained from the analytical and numerical solutions and the temperature variation with x along mid-horizontal plane y = 0.5 obtained from the analytical and numerical solutions are compared.
